Nice job commenting your code. This will really pay off when others look at your code, or when you return to your code after some time.

The letters looks great and the guardians now know when the team practice will be. Nice job!

I like the details of your letters to the player guardians. Nice work!

Overall Comments
Excellent work with this project. You have successfully completed all of the requirements for the exceeds expectations grade. Your code is laid out into many functions that do one task each, and all of your variables are named well. Well done.

Your project did not run when I got it. Without a welcome-letters directory in the project, python could not create the parent letters. No big deal though. Just add this directory, and your project works flawlessly. For your comments you don't have to write quite as many as you are doing. Just general information of what is happening for a couple of lines like a for loop, or when something not immediately evident at a glance is happening.

Great work once again on your project.
